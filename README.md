# Information Expression: Discover Tools

This repository contains several tools created on an internal Infrastructure eXpression (IX) project that allow for the capture of various infrastructure and network information, and allows for the conversion of the collected data into a [Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html) 2.1 format.

The results from ForenSTIX and all tools under the AutoDiscover frontend can be viewed in the [Structured Threat Intelligence Graph (STIG)](https://github.com/idaholab/STIG) application.
